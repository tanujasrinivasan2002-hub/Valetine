# Valentine Page

This repository contains a simple static page (`index.html`) meant to be shared as a link.

How to share:
- Option A (recommended): Make the repository public and enable GitHub Pages to serve the site. Then copy the Pages URL and share it over WhatsApp.
- Option B: Keep the repo private and deploy the `index.html` to a hosting service (Netlify, Vercel) and share the generated URL.

If you'd like, I can create the remote on GitHub and push — tell me whether you want the repo public or private and the desired repo name.
